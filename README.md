# E(2)-Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for TSP

This repository contains code for the project in the Harvard course AM220: Geometric Methods for Machine Learning. The project develops an E(2)-Equivariant GNN based by adapting the architecture of NequIP for interatomic potentials. 

## Abstract

We introduce an E(2)-equivariant graph neural network encoder for the 2D Euclidean Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP). By adapting Nequipâ€™s E(3)-equivariant architecture to the 2D setting
of TSP, our model efficiently encodes translation, rotation, and reflection symmetries in the input graph. We compare our encoder in an end-to-end supervised link-prediction pipeline against a state-of-the-art Graph ConvNet encoder, where we due to computational constraints only train on 4% of the standard dataset (51 200 samples) for 20- and 50-city instances. Our model reduces the optimality gap by about 25 % and 10 %, respectively. Moreover, t-SNE visualizations of the learned graph embeddings reveal that our encoder clusters geometrically equivalent tours in the same latent region, demonstrating explicit enforcement of E(2)-equivariance. These results highlight our models ability to improve data efficiency when learning the TSP.
